#Program running instructions
In order to run this program, create a **rsa-key pair** with **private** and **public** files named **autoscalingKey** and **autoscalingKey.pub** respectively. 
You will also need to provide the **access_key** and **secret_key** variables for your user role configured in **AliCloud Role and Access Management Console**. 
Variables can either be stored in a file named **terraform.tfvars** or can be supplied at runtime.
